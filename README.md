## Next Steps  
- [ ] Add Slather to generate test coverage reports for Xcode projects & hook it into CI.
- [ ] Add EarlGrey - native iOS UI automation test framework that enables you to write clear, concise tests
- [ ] Add Circle CI to automate the development process. 
- [ ] Add iOSSnapshotTestCase to avoid regression.
- [ ] Add SwiftLint to enforce code style and conventions.
